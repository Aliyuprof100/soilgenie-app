## The Problem

Nigerian agriculture, the backbone of our economy, faces significant challenges. Farmers often rely on traditional methods, leading to inefficient fertilizer use, depleted soil health, and vulnerability to unpredictable weather. Access to scientific soil testing is expensive, slow, and logistically challenging for the majority of smallholder farmers. This results in lower yields, wasted resources, and reduced profitability, hindering both food security and economic growth.

## Our Solution: SoilGenie

SoilGenie bridges this gap by placing a **Digital Agronomist** in the hands of every farmer. By leveraging cutting-edge satellite technology and artificial intelligence, we deliver affordable, instant, and actionable insights without requiring a single physical sample.

### Core Features

*   üõ∞Ô∏è **AI-Powered Soil Analysis:** Get instant predictions for key soil properties like Nitrogen, pH, and Organic Carbon using the latest satellite imagery.
*   üå± **Personalized Fertilizer Recommendations:** Receive specific fertilizer advice (type and quantity) tailored to your farm's unique needs and crop type.
*   ‚òÄÔ∏è **Hyperlocal Weather Forecasts:** Access daily and weekly weather forecasts for your exact farm location, not just the nearest city.
*   üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Farm Mapping:** Securely draw, save, and manage your farm boundaries for precise, plot-by-plot analysis.

## The Vision

Our mission is to democratize precision agriculture. We believe that by providing accessible data, we can empower a new generation of farmers to make smarter, data-driven decisions. SoilGenie aims to be the central operating system for small and medium-scale farms across Nigeria and eventually, Africa.
